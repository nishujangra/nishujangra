### Hi, I'm Nishant

**Backend Engineer | Systems & Infrastructure Developer | Open Source Enthusiast**

I build secure and efficient backend systems using Go, Rust, and Linux.
Most of my work focuses on networking, infrastructure, orchestration, and backend automation.
I also enjoy writing about backend design, Linux internals, and system administration.
